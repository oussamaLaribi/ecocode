Installation documentation
==========================

Requirements
------------

- Docker
- Docker-compose

Project structure
-----------------

Here is a preview of project tree :

```txt
Ecocode              # Root directory
|
+--java-plugin       # JAVA
|
+--php-plugin        # PHP
|
+--python-plugin     # Python
|
\--docker-compose.yml   # Docker compose file
```

You will find more information about the pluginsâ€™ architecture in their folders

Howto build the SonarQube ecoCode plugins
-----------------------------------------

### Requirements

- Java >= 11.0.17
- Mvn 3
- SonarQube 9.4 or higher

### Build the code

You can build the project code by running the following command in the `src` directory.
Maven will download the required dependencies.

```sh
./tool_build.sh
```

Each plugin is generated in its own `<plugin>/target` directory, but they are also copied to the `lib` directory.

Howto install SonarQube dev environment
---------------------------------------

### Requirements

You must have built the plugins (see the steps above).

### Start SonarQube (if first time)

Run the SonarQube + PostgreSQL stack:

```sh
./tool_docker-init.sh
```

Check if the containers are up:

```sh
docker ps
```

You should see two lines (one for sonarqube and one for postgres).
If there is only postgres, check the logs:

```sh
./tool_docker-logs.sh
```

If you have this error on run:
`web_1  | [1]: max virtual memory areas vm.max_map_count [65530] is too low, increase to at least [262144]`
you can allocate more virtual memory:

```sh
sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
```

For Windows:

```sh
wsl -d docker-desktop
sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
```

Go to http://localhost:9000 and use these credentials:

```txt
login: admin
password: admin
```

When you are connected, generate a new token:

`My Account -> Security -> Generate Tokens`

![img.png](docs/resources/img.png)
![img_1.png](docs/resources/img_1.png)

Start again your services using the token:

```sh
TOKEN=MY_TOKEN docker-compose up --build -d
```

### Reinstall SonarQube (if needed)

```sh
# first clean all containers and resources used
./tool_docker-clean.sh

# then, install from scratch de SonarQube containers and resources
./tool_docker-init.sh
```

Howto install Plugin Ecocode
----------------------------

Install dependencies from the root directory:

```sh
./tool_build.sh
```

Result : JAR files (one per plugin) will be copied in `lib` repository after build.

Howto start or stop service (already installed)
-----------------------------------------------

Once you did the installation a first time (and then you did custom configuration like quality gates, quality profiles, ...),
if you only want to start (or stop properly) existing services :

```sh
./tool_start.sh
./tool_stop.sh
```

Howto create a release
----------------------

1. add release notes in `CHANGELOG.md` file
   1. create a new section under `Unreleased` section with the new version title
   2. respect [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format
2. add tag and push it (an error occur if you haven't sufficient permissions)
3. a new automatic workflow started to create a new release
