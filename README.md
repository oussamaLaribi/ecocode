======================================

*ecoCode* is a collective project aiming to reduce environmental footprint of software at the code level. The goal of the project is to provide a list of static code analyzers to highlight code structures that may have a negative ecological impact: energy and resources over-consumption, "fatware", shortening terminals' lifespan, etc.

ecoCode is based on evolving catalogs of [good practices](docs/rules), for various technologies. A SonarQube plugin then implement these catalogs as rules for scanning your projects.

**Warning**: this is still a very early stage project. Any feedback or contribution will be highly appreciated. Please refer to the contribution section.

### eco-design SonarQube plugin

![Ekko logo](docs/resources/5ekko.png)

There is two kind of plugins :

- One for web / backoffice (PHP, Python, Java), using smells described in the 2nd edition of the repository published in september 2015
You can find all the rules [here (in french)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nujR4EnajnR0NSXjvBW3GytOopDyTfvl3eTk2XGLh5Y/edit#gid=1386834576)
The current repository is for web / backOffice
- One for mobile (Android), using [a set of smells](https://olegoaer.perso.univ-pau.fr/android-energy-smells/) theorised by Olivier Le Goa√´r for Android.
You can find this plugin in the repository [here](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecocode-mobile)

### How a SonarQube plugin works

Code is parsed to be transformed as AST. AST will allow you to access one or more nodes of your code.
For example, you‚Äôll be able to access of all your `for` loop, to explore content etc.

To better understand AST structure, y a can use [AST Explorer](https://astexplorer.net/)

üöÄ Getting Started
------------------

You can download each plugin separatly or you can directly use a [all-in-one docker-compose](INSTALL.md)
